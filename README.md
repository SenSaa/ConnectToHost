2) On your Android device - Start this client application.

3) Click on the socket icon on the action bar, and enter the port number used by the server app as well as the ip address of the computer running the server application, and connect.

4) Insert a text message into the text field, then press "send message" button, which will send your input to the server.

5) Now that the client input has been displayed on the server side, you can write back to the client, and press "enter" key.
